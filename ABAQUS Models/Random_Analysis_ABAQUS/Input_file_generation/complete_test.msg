 ***WARNING: THE CHOLESKY DECOMPOSITION WARNINGS GIVEN BELOW MOST LIKELY ARE 
             CAUSED BY THE LINEAR DEPENDENCIES IN THE CORRELATION MATRIX. THEY 
             CAN ALSO BE CAUSED BY INCLUDING NON-PARTICIPATING MODES IN THE

             THE NUMBER OF MODES FOR PROJECTION SHOULD REMOVE THE WARNINGS.
